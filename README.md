Welcome to the React Native Stopwatch App project! This application is designed to provide a simple and functional stopwatch with additional features such as lap recording.

## üìñ About
This project is a result of my work for the Technical Challenge for Shopify‚Äôs Engineering Internship program.
I was provided with a basic project structure that included the necessary files and dependencies. My task was to write the code to implement the stopwatch functionality and ensure that it worked correctly.
More details about the challenge you can see here [Shopify Mobile Technical Challenge](https://github.com/Shopify/eng-intern-assessment-react-native)

## ‚≠ê Features

- The stopwatch features four buttons: Start, Stop, Lap, and Reset. Upon opening the app, only the Start button is enabled.
- The stopwatch begins counting when the user clicks the Start button. Subsequently, the button‚Äôs title changes to ‚ÄòPause‚Äô or ‚ÄòResume‚Äô. Upon pressing the Stop button, it reverts to ‚ÄòStart‚Äô.
- The stopwatch stops counting when the user clicks the stop button.
- The stopwatch resets to zero when the user clicks the reset button.
- The stopwatch records and displays laps when the user clicks the lap button.
- The stopwatch determines the best and worst laps based on durations and renders them with different colours (red for the worst lap, green for the best).
